# ML_LAB

## About  
**ML_LAB** is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and experiments conducted as part of my Machine Learning (ML) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning path. It showcases hands-on work with classical algorithms, data sets and practical implementations to build a good foundation for ML and statistical modelling.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Here is a summary of the key files and notebooks:

- `BST.ipynb` – Implementation and exploration of Binary Search Tree operations.  
- `MNIST.ipynb` – Working with the MNIST dataset (handwritten digit recognition) and building a basic classifier.  
- `Prog2nd.ipynb` – Second programming assignment / exercise notebook (details inside).  
- `Prog5.ipynb` – Fifth programming exercise / practical.  
- `README.md` – This document.

> Note: All files are Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format.

## 🧠 Learning Focus & Goals  
My current study plan (from August 2025 onwards) focuses on:  
- Machine Learning: understanding algorithms, model building, evaluation, and deployment.  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): building a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking, complexity analysis, and Python implementations.  
- Python: leveraging the skills I developed earlier to implement ML/Datastructure solutions.  
- English communication: improving clarity in code documentation, comments and README style.

This repository serves as a living lab for implementing what I learn, experimenting with ideas, and iterating.

## ✅ What you’ll find here  
- Cleanly documented Jupyter notebooks with explanations, code, and results.  
- Examples that tie algorithmic/data-structure concepts (e.g., BST) to practical use.  
- A simple ML experiment on the MNIST dataset to illustrate data loading, preprocessing, training and evaluation.  
- A chronological progression of programming exercises (Prog2nd, Prog5) to track learning over time.
